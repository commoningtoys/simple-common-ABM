# Simple Common Model
> this model is based on the iris-model. In this simplified versions the commoners walk around a common area and use it. The common area is made up of single cells which get used up by the commoners and need to be restored when consumed. If a single part remains consumed for too long ot becomes unusable. The Commoners that are close to a consumed area engage in a decision making process in which one of them should repair the consumed common. If the decision making results in no one reparing the common the latter my become unusable. The commoners that engae in the decision making are those within the "vision" of the common in question; a vision of one equals to the 8 most close cells around the common, a vision of 2 it includes also the surrounding 14 and so on. If more than one commoner decides to repair the common a conflict will arise, in which a random commoner will be chosen to repair the common, whil the others become unhappy. A commoner will gain happyness by resting, while not using up all the monthly hours will result in lost happyness [this might bbe changed]. There are four commoner behaviors or traits: tendency to work, to rest, to swap, or to execute all three of them.
